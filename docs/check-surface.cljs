;; docs/check-surface.cljs — do the hosts this repo declares actually exist?
;;
;;   nbb docs/check-surface.cljs            # from the repo root
;;
;; The README states, as a dated measurement, that every etzhayyim host this
;; repo depends on is NXDOMAIN. A dated measurement rots. This re-takes it.
;;
;; It does not carry a hardcoded host list — it extracts the hosts from the
;; files that declare them (here: PROJECT.jsonld, the agent descriptor
;; kotodama.jsonld, and CLAUDE.md), so adding a host to the config brings it
;; under the check automatically.
;;
;; Fourth copy of a script that originated in cloud-itonami/game-play-uploader
;; and reached this repo via cloud-itonami/games and cloud-itonami/gameya. It is
;; generic — it reads the hosts out of whichever repo it is run in, and needs no
;; per-repo edit beyond this comment. Keep the copies in sync by copying, not by
;; diverging.
;;
;; ONE DIVERGENCE from the gameya copy, made 2026-08-13: `.md` is in `scan-exts`.
;; Copied verbatim it reported 4 declared hosts here and silently missed a
;; fifth — `br8bojxp.etzhayyim.com`, which this repo declares only in CLAUDE.md.
;; A checker blind to a declaration site prints the same "3 of 4 do not exist"
;; whether the file it cannot read is fine or not, so under-reporting is
;; indistinguishable from a clean reading. Port `.md` back to the earlier copies
;; rather than dropping it here.
;;
;; Exit codes are three-valued on purpose. "Could not measure" must not be
;; reachable from the same exit code as "measured, all fine":
;;
;;   0  every declared host resolves
;;   1  at least one declared host does not resolve   <- the state on 2026-08-13
;;   3  COULD NOT ANSWER — no hosts were extracted, or the control host failed
;;      (i.e. this machine has no working DNS, so an NXDOMAIN here would mean
;;      nothing). Never report a pass in this case.
